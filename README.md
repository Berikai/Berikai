Uhm, hello! I'm an 18 y/o boy who is coding mostly for fun.

## Programming Languages

I have experienced coding with mostly **C#** and some other languages like **C++**, **VB.NET**, **Dart**. I'm into javascript and web technologies right now.

## How professional I am

I've met with computers in the age 3. I remember that I have started coding with **VB.NET**. 

Anyways, I guess I know the basics about the concept "coding" for years. 
I didn't learn how to code to do stuff. 
I've always come up with an idea an just jump into it and I've always searched for how to do's but you know what is amazing, it's my way to learn.

Learning while doing the thing that I don't know by searching how to do that. 
So, to be honest I'm not a professional coder in any language but I guess if I need to use a language for the stuff that I want to do, I'm always like lets goo without even being familiar with it.

## What kind of things I've done so far

Hmmmmmm, let me think.

Okay, I've made,
- FTP based RAT program while in 2015 y/o with **VB.NET**.
- A mobile platform game called Stress Head while in 2017 by using **Unity C#**.
- Auto Roulette Gambler Bot in a specific website with specified strategy in 2018 by using **C#**.
- Instagram Automatic Repost Bot with **Visual C#** with a library called InstagramApiSharp in 2019.
- External Game Hacks to GTA5 and Transformice (for educational purposes only) with **C++** in 2020.
- A cute website for my one and only girlfriend with using **ReactJS** in 2021.
