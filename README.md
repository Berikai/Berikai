Uhm, hello! I'm 19 y/o who is coding mostly for fun.

## Programming Languages

I have experienced coding with mostly **C#** and some other languages like **C++**, **VB.NET**, **Dart**, **Javascript**, **Python**.
## How professional I am

I've met with computers in the age 3. I remember that I have started coding with **VB.NET**. 

Anyways, I guess I know the basics about the concept "coding" for years. 
I didn't learn how to code to do stuff directly. 
I've always come up with an idea and just jump into it and I've always did my research in the process of bringing life my ideas. It's my way to learn.

So, to be honest I'm not a professional coder in any language but I guess if I need to use a language for the stuff that I want to do, I'm always like lets go without even being familiar with it. Actually the basics of all of them usually same, so I'm easily handling it.

## What kind of things I've done so far

Hmmmmmm, let me think.

Okay, I've made,
- FTP based RAT program while in 2015 with **VB.NET**.
- A mobile platform game called Stress Head while in 2017 by using **Unity C#**.
- Auto Roulette Gambler Bot in a specific website with specified strategy in 2018 by using **C#**.
- Instagram Automatic Repost Bot with **Visual C#** with a library called InstagramApiSharp in 2019.
- External Game Hacks to GTA5 and Transformice (for educational purposes only) with **C++** in 2020.
- A cute website for my one and only girlfriend with using **ReactJS** in 2021.
- A pixel buddy for you running on your desktop with **C#** in 2022. (Currently working on)
